Implementation of OpenVR API. This code is based on the hellovr_opengl example included in OpenVR.


## Notes

0. Tested with the HTC Vive Pre and the Oculus consumer version on Windows 10.
1. For the HTC Vive you need to have Steam and SteamVR installed on your computer. For the Oculus you need the Oculus application.
